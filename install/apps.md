Awesome applications for vanilla OS X installs
==============================================

This is a list of applications that I install on every Mac that I use. They
can be installed in any order unless explictely stated otherwise.

Utilities
---------
These are required installs for any kind of dev work. They should be 
installed in order:

1. Xcode [(Mac App Store)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)
2. XQuartz [(Website)](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)

Command Line
------------
These apps are only used in the terminal. Not included are programs installed
with Homebrew -- you can look at the seperate brew file in this repo for that.



Boilerplate
-----------
Boilerplate apps are my standard set of apps that I use on every computer.
**Github for Mac** should be installed first, although it's likely you are
already aware of that it since you are viewing this document.
